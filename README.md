# convolutional-neural-networks

Repository for the convolutional neural networks class of the master's degree in 
computing sciences. Here I offer small descriptions for every practice but all 
practices and the final project have a folder with the documentation included.

`python` `colab` `neural networks` 

## Practice 1

Four exercises with the purpose of creating some kernels by hand and applying 
opacity filters to a color image.

## Practice 2

Two exercises with the purpose of creating some kernels by hand and applying 
them to a color image to extract vertical and horizontal edges.

## Practice 3

Implementation of linear regression using gradient descent to predict the heights of 
several children based on their ages.

## Practice 4

Implementation of a Multiclass Artificial Neural Network for the classification
of images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Practice 5
 
Implementation of linear regression in TensorFlow using gradient descent to predict
the heights of several children based on their ages.

## Final Project

Final project of the convolutional neural networks class. It consists of the 
implementation of a convolutional neural network for image classification. Colab is 
used to train the neural network faster. Here are the links for colab notebooks used.

This is the final notebook used after all tests:

These other two notebook were used for testing and learning:
